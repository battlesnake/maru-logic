# V1


## V1 pcb:

 - Toggle latches don't work

 - Need 6 LEDs on outputs of outermost gates, the gaps are ugly

 - XOR / AND silkscreens are the switched?


## V1 case:

 -


# V2

Idea: tie OUT of LED chain to inputs of actual gate, so that when toggling
an input, the gate output doesn't start to update until the input has
completely updated.


## V2 pcb

 -


## V2 case
